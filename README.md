We also did our application testing, debugging, and preparing the final presentation.


 ## Overview of Sakhi Finance Simulation App Design
  SakhiFinance App, an interactive financial simulation app where users manage a virtual household budget and make real-life financial decisions.

  The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the backend is built using Node.js and Express.
  The app works in a very simple way. When the user opens the app, she sees big buttons, icons, and voice guidance.

She can select Budget Jars, Decision Simulation, Fraud Alert, or Progress.

The app gives real-life situations and shows immediate consequences of financial decisions.

This helps women gain confidence and practical knowledge.

  5) Fraud page

  >In the Fraud Alert section, the user sees a situation where an unknown caller asks for OTP.

> If the user chooses to share OTP, the app shows it as a wrong decision.

> If the user cuts the call, the app shows it as a correct and safe action.

> This helps users understand digital fraud through practice.
